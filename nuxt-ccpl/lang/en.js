Hearing screening, particularly in maternity wards, allows for early identification of hearing deficiencies, followed by diagnosis and assessment to evaluate the severity and specific needs. For children with profound deafness, cochlear implants provide a technological solution for better auditory integration. Multidisciplinary support, in close collaboration with families and the child, ensures comprehensive care. For very young children, home follow-up is implemented to facilitate their development from an early age. Regarding school integration, monitoring is provided at all levels, from preschool to primary, secondary, and higher education, whether in regular education or in specialized schools such as École Intégrée. In parallel, specialized speech therapy follow-up is provided to develop the children's linguistic and communication skills, according to their specific needs.",

            content1: 'Individual and collective speech therapy plays a crucial role. Teaching children who hear little or poorly to understand a speaker, to speak, and to develop the fundamental cognitive mechanisms of language is a challenging and long-term task.<br> The daily sessions necessary to achieve the goal of linguistic communication require great efforts from the speech therapists... and especially from the children.<br> To motivate the children to accept these efforts, the speech therapists must constantly offer new communication activities, which require the preparation of attractive and frequently renewed materials (educational games, pictures, pictograms, miniature objects and characters, etc.).',
            content2: 'It is mainly the speech therapy teams that make these efforts and that particularly deserve credit for their results, serving as a reference model for many Belgian and foreign centers. The role of speech therapists is also to contribute, through appropriate parental guidance, to ensuring that parents are, at all ages, the key players in the linguistic development of their deaf or hard-of-hearing child.',
            content3: 'Sign language is integrated into the support process and even into linguistic rehabilitation when necessary.<br> In practice, this involves the integration of sign language users into the interdisciplinary team.<br> Deaf facilitators fulfill this role by organizing sign language communication workshops that are part of various rehabilitation programs, or through individual sessions focused on training specific skills (memory, phonological analysis, conceptualization, general knowledge, etc.).<br> Parents are also invited to become familiar with sign language and to acquire vocabulary in this language, which can be used in combination with Cued Speech (LPC) depending on the project in place.<br> This approach allows children to become familiar with this language in a positive and enjoyable way. Linguistic skill transfers between spoken languages and sign languages are common observations in linguistic development.'

    history: {
        title: 'History of the Center',
        intro: 'In 1965, parents concerned with providing their deaf or hard-of-hearing children with a high-level education founded the Centre Comprendre et Parler, initiated by Dr. Olivier Périer.',
        subtitle1: '1965-1980',
        content1: 'During the first 15 years of its existence, the Center exclusively used audio-oral methods based on the use of residual hearing and lip reading. It particularly invested in P. Guberina’s verbo-tonal method, which proved very effective for the development of voice, articulation, and speech melody. In its early years, the Center paid particular attention to the development of prosthetic adaptation techniques, considering them an essential part of the rehabilitation process: recent advances in this field have significantly contributed to the overall improvement of rehabilitation outcomes.',
        subtitle2: '1980 - Today',
        content2_1: 'Starting in 1980, the experience gained and the reference to the evolution of methods worldwide led the team to integrate additional communication tools involving the visual sphere alongside the previous audio-oral methods.',
        content2_2: 'On the one hand, the Cued Speech (LPC) system, an ingenious method that clarifies and supplements lip reading, and on the other, Signed French (FS), which uses signs from the deaf language in addition to speech.',
        content2_3: 'The introduction of LPC and FS allowed a true leap forward in communication and the acquisition of fundamental mechanisms of oral language, while laying the foundation for later access to the sign language of the deaf community.',
        content2_4: 'The combination of these two techniques in the form of Fully Signed and Coded French (FCSC) marked the abandonment of FS. FCSC is a creation of parents who wanted to combine the advantages of a complete perception of speech via LPC with the ease and natural expression of their child at a young age through the use of signs from sign language. FCSC constitutes an internationally recognized valuable contribution to the methodology of educating hearing-impaired children. Many deaf children have benefited from it (see the Documentation/Publications section).',
        content2_5: 'Recent technological advances, particularly the advent of effective cochlear implants since the 1990s, have again led to modifications in practice. LPC remains a complementary tool to cochlear implants to give the child access to fine phonological precision under all circumstances (e.g., in noisy environments). Signs are still used during the early exchanges to stimulate parent-child interaction. They also play a role during encouraged contacts with members of the deaf community who share this language.',
        content2_6: 'The emergence of cochlear implants also had an unexpected effect. Once the prosthetic support became highly effective, the concomitant difficulties presented by some deaf children and adolescents became more apparent: "dys" disorders (dysphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, memory problems, attention deficits, visual integration difficulties, reading comprehension issues), or even associated disabilities. Future challenges will involve developing evaluation tools for these concomitant disorders with hearing loss and offering rehabilitation paths validated by scientific evidence or adjusted practices.'
